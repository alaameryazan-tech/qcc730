/** @addtogroup peripherals_flash

  The QSPI Flash module provides flash operation APIs.

  drv_flash_init() initializes the flash module and must be called
  before any other function in this module. The input parameter - Config -
  must be set based on the specific flash used.

  Flash read/write/erase/writereg operations cannot be performed simultaneously.
  There can be only one operation ongoing at a time. A mutex is used to protect it.

  Flash read/write/erase/writereg support blocking operations on Fermion.

  For a blocking operation, the related function returns until the
  required number of data/status are read/written/erased successfully, or
  there is an error. If the required number is large, the related function
  may take some time to return. It should be taken into consideration if
  the product is power and time sensitive.
